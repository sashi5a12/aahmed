======= Developer Coding Standards/Ethics ======================

10. Please follow the normal java coding convention. 
    Indent your code and Use spaces instead of tabs to indents (most editors let u set this)
    Use the C style braces convention i.e
    
    public static void foo()
    {
    }

11. Always compile and test your code b4 checking it in cvs.
