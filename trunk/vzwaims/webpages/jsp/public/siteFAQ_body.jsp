        The application you are working with may have a status of "Accepted". You cannot change devices for an "Accepted" application. An "Accepted" application means its already been processed and potentially moved to production. Hence this version has been tagged. If you have updated a previously "Accepted" application to support new devices, you will need to clone the existing version and then select the new devices the application supports.
