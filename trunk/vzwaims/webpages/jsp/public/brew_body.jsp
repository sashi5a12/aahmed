            <strong>The Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless<sup>TM</sup></strong>... BREW<sup>TM</sup> platform. <br />
            The BREW platform allows developers to create applications that operate on any BREW-enabled
            wireless phone. The BREW platform sits between the chip system software and the application,
            making the phone's functionality available to the application without requiring the developer to
            have the chip system source code or even a direct relationship with a device manufacturer.
            Application providers will be able to rapidly develop a wide variety of small, transportable
            applications in familiar programming languages such as C and C++. Verizon Wireless subscribers
            are able to download these applications over the Verizon Wireless network, and run them on any
            BREW-enabled wireless phone. <p />

            We are actively seeking high quality
            applications to make available to our subscribers. Verizon Wireless is already selling several
            BREW-enabled wireless phones, including one with a color screen. Each phone will be capable of
            running robust applications enhanced with graphics and sound, that are TRUE BREW<sup>TM</sup> certified.<p />

            Verizon Wireless would like to invite you to join the BREW Developer Community now, and we
            urge you to go to www.qualcomm.com/brew/ to register and download the SDK. As an authenticated
            BREW Developer, you will have access to the QUALCOMM Developer Extranet, as well as support
            from QUALCOMM while developing your application. Verizon Wireless continually strives to develop
            relationships with the innovative application developers.
