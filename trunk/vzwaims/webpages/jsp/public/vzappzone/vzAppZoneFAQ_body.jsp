    <b><a name="Ques1">How long does it take to upload my application onto the VZAppZone platform (from the time my application has been submitted)?</a></b> <br/>
    It should take approximately 2 weeks to load an application onto the server assuming that the application passes all mandatory test requirements.

    <b><a name="Ques2">What test requirements does my application need to pass in order to be make it into the VZAppZone catalog?</a></b> <br/>
    Go to <a href="http://www.qpqa.com/compliance.html" class="a" target="_blank">Intertek's website</a> for a description of the test cases.

    <%-- Question 3--%>
    <b><a name="Ques3">What does compatibility testing involve and who will do the testing?</a></b> <br/>
    Third-party testing labs will conduct the compatibility testing. Exactly what will be tested will differ from application to application, but generally, testing will cover the following:
    <ul>
        <li>How the application interacts with core device functionality. For example, how the application handles scenarios such as an instant message or other system alerts being pushed to the device while the user is in another application.</li>
        <li>Core application stability over time. Numerous events will be sent into the event queue to see how the application handles them and to look for instability (i.e. crashes), memory usage (i.e. leaks), etc.</li>
        <li>Major application functionality. Testing will be conducted to make sure the major functionality you claim for your application actually is in the application. We will not test this functionality for "correctness" from an end-user perspective.</li>
        <li>Any operator or manufacturer-specific look and feel requirements.</li>
        <li>Compatibility with the target device(s).</li>
        <li>Interaction with required accessories.</li>
        <li>Interoperability with the device applications.</li>
    </ul>
