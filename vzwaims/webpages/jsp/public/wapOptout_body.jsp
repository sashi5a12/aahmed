                	<p>
	                	<i>Optimized View for Mobile Web</i> is an enhancement to Mobile Web 2.0 that allows subscribers to 
                        access HTML content from their mobile devices.
                	</p>
                	<p>
	                	<i>Optimized View for Mobile Web</i> will optimize the format of a web site so that it is quick to render 
                        on the mobile device and easy for subscribers to view and navigate. Optimized View for Mobile Web will be 
                        available on most mobile devices and allow Verizon Wireless subscribers to use their wireless devices to 
                        view full HTML sites via the Search or Go To URL functions on the Verizon Wireless Mobile Web portal and/or their browsers. 
                	</p>
					<p>
            			The integrity of the website will remain intact as the service is only intended to optimize the presentation of 
                        the content for delivery in a format manageable for mobile devices. Some HTML content may not be supported on the 
                        mobile device (e.g. Flash), and in these cases, the content will be represented either by an image, animated gif, or text, etc.
            		</p>
                    <p>
	            		<i>Optimized View for Mobile Web</i> will not optimize mobile sites that follow the W3C mobile 
                        addressing standards (i.e., .mobi, pda., wap., m., mobile., etc.) 
            		</p>
            		<p>
            			To ensure your website addressing standards follow the W3C model, please review the following Developer Guide.
