        <p>Dashboard creates an ecosystem for consuming, promoting and merchandising
            VZW's multimedia content and services. Dashboard was built on Adobe's
            Flash Cast&#0153; platform and leverages their leadership in providing best-in-class
            content authoring tools (i.e. Flash) and user interface design. Dashboard is
            a platform designed to drive additional data for Verizon and our partners by
            improving the customer experience and content discoverability.</p>

        <p>Dashboard Channels provide linkage to VZW services:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Mobile Web</li>
            <li>GetitNow Applications</li>
            <li>GIN Search</li>
            <li>V Cast Video</li>
            <li>V Cast Music</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Supports ads, promotions and direct access to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Games</li>
            <li>Ringtones and Ringback Tones</li>
            <li>Songs</li>
            <li>Applications</li>
            <li>Wallpapers</li>
            <li>Mobile Web Sites</li>
            <li>VZ Navigator</li>
            <li>ESPN MVP</li>
            <li>Pix Place (Mobile Web link-away),</li>
            <li>Consumer eMail (Mobile Web link-away), etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Dashboard service consists of three major components:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A content application server</li>
            <li>A Flash-based handset client, and</li>
            <li>
                A collection of rich multimedia Flash "channels"
                (i.e. mobile widgets).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>These VZW programmed channels are updated by providing content to the device
            from the content server over the EV-DO network.</p>

        <p>Each channel will be able to render Flash content, launch an application, or
            invoke other media handlers on the device to process the selected content.
            As such, the Dashboard application will be capable of launching a BREW-based
            WAP 2.0 browser (Access), VZW Tones application, Mobile Shop, video
            catalog/player, music catalog/player, BREW based search application, et al
            on the handset in response to a user request from within a content channel.
            This will allow VZW to create a simple and unified experience across a range
            of consumer data services.</p>

        <p>The handset client will contain a default landing channel and utilize a
            vertical "carousel" for navigation to all other channels.</p>

        <p>Users will be able to select from a set of channels, including (but not
            limited to):</p>

        <ul>
            <li>VZW Showcase (for featured information/artists/upcoming events, games, etc)</li>
            <li>Games</li>
            <li>Music</li>
            <li>Entertainment</li>
            <li>News</li>
            <li>Weather</li>
            <li>Sports</li>
            <li>ESPN</li>
            <li>GIN Search</li>
            <li>Business</li>
            <li>Community</li>
            <li>Tones & Extras (wallpapers & ringtones)</li>
            <li>Mobile Web (news, weather, sports, links from within the channels to WAP pages)</li>
            <li>Third Party branded Channels</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Within each of the channels (as applicable), users will be able to
            personalize content delivered to the user by the server. For example, users
            will be able to select 3 zip codes for personalized weather forecasts. News,
            entertainment and other channel information may also be tailored per zip
            code and/or areas of interest.</p>

        <p>Each of the VZW sourced channels will receive information from the Dashboard
            content application server, which aggregates content from multiple providers
            and distributes it to the handset application. Information retrieval and
            updates occur upon customer request or when the application is launched.</p>
