<b><a name="Ques1">What is Dashboard?</a></b> <br/>
Dashboard is the Verizon Wireless implementation of the Adobe Flash Cast&#0153; platform. It represents a new, Flash&reg;
based, graphically rich front end to all of Verizon Wireless' data services.
<br/>
A Dashboard 'channel' is a Flash&reg; based application and an associated data feed that you can develop to generate
revenue and extend your brand.

<b><a name="Ques4">What is the overall process for developing a channel?</a></b> <br/>

The channel provider refers generally to both the channel developer (who develops the channel assets) and the feed
provider (who provides the channel's data source e.g. weather information).
<br/>

The channel provider must:
<ol>
    <li>Submit a channel concept to Verizon Wireless</li>
    <li>Secure Verizon Wireless approval on the channel concept</li>
    <li>gain access to the Adobe Mobile AppBuilder Program and attent Flash Cast&#0153; training.</li>
    <li>Develop a channel using the Flash&reg; CS3 Professional, Adobe Mobile AppBuilder and Adobe-hosted test server.
    </li>
    <li>Develop the channel data source.</li>
    <li>Complete the Dashboard Channel Submission document.</li>
    <li>Work with Verizon Wireless to determine how often channel content is updated.</li>
    <li>Complete an initial channel validation.</li>
    <li>Submit a final channel for deployment into production.</li>
    <li>Maintain the data source.</li>

<%-- Question 6--%>
<b><a name="Ques6">What does a typical Flash Cast&#0153; development team look like?</a></b> <br/>
A Flash Cast&#0153; channel development team generally consists of one Flash&reg; Developer familiar with Flash Lite
1.1, one QA Engineer and one Project Manager. Depending of the format of the content feed, there may also be a need for
someone to write and debug a content transform module using XSLT.

<b><a name="Ques7">I already have content that I've developed for a different Flash Cast&#0153; implementation. Will my
    existing content work with Dashboard?</a></b> <br/>
