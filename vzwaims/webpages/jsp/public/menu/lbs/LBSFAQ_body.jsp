        No. From the network perspective, the Verizon Wireless commercial LBS implementation is completely independent
        of the E-911 infrastructure. At the device level, however, the same gpsOne chipset is used. On the E-911
        infrastructure, communications occur over the SS7 signaling network, and the only time a device's location can
        be obtained is when the subscriber dials 9-1-1. For the commercial LBS service, the communication occurs via
        TCP/IP over the 1xRTT or EV-DO data network.

        In MS-Based mode, the network provides the satellite information to the device, based on a rough estimate of
        where the device is located, and the device acquires the GPS signals from the satellites and calculates its
        location. After the initial fix, the device operates like an autonomous GPS receiver, until the satellite
        information must be refreshed, at which time the device goes back to the network to update the satellite
        information. MS-Based mode is appropriate for applications that require the device location to be updated
        rapidly, such as a navigation application.

        Yes. The mode is application dependent, and different features of the same application can use a different mode.
        For example, in a navigation application, if the user is looking for the nearest restaurant, the location may be
        acquired via MS-Assisted mode. However, when driving to the restaurant, the location must be updated regularly,
        so MS-Based mode is more appropriate.

        application is run, the user can set up their privacy settings, wherein they define how (Always Allow, Always
        Ask, Always Deny) and when (days of the week, times of the day) the application can acquire the location. Then,

        Verizon Wireless has taken many steps to ensure that the subscriber's location is secure. Each LBS application
        is treated as <i>untrusted</i>, meaning that the application must be authenticated prior to being allowed to
        acquire the location of the device. In addition, third party application developers must provide to Verizon
        Wireless a plan for how they ensure that the customer's location is kept secure. And they must sign a contract
        that states that they will ensure the customer's location is kept secure.

        First and foremost, think security. The protection of the customer's location is of paramount importance. Ensure
        that your application protects the customer's location data. If the customer's location is stored on your
        servers, ensure that there is no way that this information can be acquired by anyone other than people
        authorized by the customer (for example, a buddy finder application would share the user's location only with
        those buddies specifically allowed by the user), and cannot be hacked into by a third party.
