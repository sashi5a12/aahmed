            The Verizon Wireless commercial Location Based Services (LBS) platform provides the ability for developers
            to create
            applications that use the subscriber's location as part of the delivery of the service. These applications
            may be
            consumer focused, or enterprise focused. Consumer application types include navigation &amp; traffic, LBS
            games,
            mobile
            marketing, and social networking. Enterprise applications include field force automation, real estate and
            custom
            solutions.</p>

        <p>
            Verizon Wireless' commercial LBS platform is completely independent of our E-911 infrastructure. Our E-911
            implementation uses the signaling channel in the determination of the device location, whereas our
            commercial
            services
            use TCP/IP over our 1xRTT data network. LBS utilizes the gpsOne functionality built into the Qualcomm
            chipset, along
            with two network elements, to acquire the location of the device.</p>

        <p>
            Two new network elements were added to the Verizon Wireless network to implement the commercial LBS
            platform. The
            first
            network element is called the Position Determination Entity (PDE). It assists the device in acquiring its
            location.
            The
            second element is called the Location Proxy Server (LPS). It provides privacy management and control, as
            well as a
            common geo-services and geo-data platform. All consumer LBS applications must use the LPS for geo-services
            and
            geo-data.
            LBS uses two types of technology to determine location known as Assisted GPS (A-GPS) and Advanced Forward
            Link
            Trilateration (AFLT). To determine location using A-GPS the handset takes readings from closest GPS
            satellites with
            the
            help of the PDE on the network. Unlike A-GPS, AFLT does not use GPS satellites to determine location, the
            handset
            uses
            measurements of signals from nearby cellular base stations and reports the time/distance readings back
            through the
            network, which are then used to triangulate an approximate location of the handset.

            The security of our customer's location information is of paramount importance. In addition to the
            requirements of
            confidentiality and storage and use of information, Verizon Wireless has certain policies and procedures
            that must
            be adhered to. Please keep this in mind as you develop your applications.
        </p>

        <p>
            At this time, LBS is only being offered on BREW handsets. As such, please review the BREW program details by
