            VZAppZone&#0153; offers a marketplace of mobile applications to Smartphones and BlackBerry&#0174; handheld users, 
            allowing Verizon Wireless customers to browse and purchase add-on applications, download a purchased application 
            over-the-air to their device, and charge directly to the Verizon Wireless bill. VZAppZone makes discovery and 
            delivery of the mobile applications a breeze by arranging them in an easy-to-use catalog, and is supported on 
            several different operating systems (OS), including Windows Mobile&#0174; and RIM&#0174; . Verizon Wireless is 
            actively seeking quality applications to make available to its subscribers. Application providers may develop 
            their applications using the normal device application programming interfaces (APIs). We invite you to join as 
            an Alliance, by registering, and submitting your application for acceptance and testing by Verizon Wireless, 
            so that it can ultimately be made available to Verizon Wireless customers.
        </p>
