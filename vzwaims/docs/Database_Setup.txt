Run the following scripts to (re)set up the database:

1) droptables.sql
	This script will delete all tables in the current schema whose names begin with 'AIMS_'.
	Note: Since this is a DDL, it cannot be rolled back.

2) createtables.sql
	This script will create the tables and also the primary keys.

3) create_col_comments.sql
	This script will add comments to the table columns.

4) not_null_constraints.sql
	This will add the NOT NULL constraints to the appropriate columns.

5) createunique_indexes.sql
	This script will create the unique indexes on columns which are unique (apart from the primary key).

6) createforeignkeys.sql
	This script will create the relationships between the tables.

7) create_indexes_on_foreign_keys.sql
        This script will create (non-unique) indexes on the foreign keys. This prevents locking of the whole table incase of an unexpected update of the primary key.

8) Add data


9) gather_stats_analyze.sql
	This will gather the statistics of the schema for the cost based optimizer to make better informed decisions on query plans.
