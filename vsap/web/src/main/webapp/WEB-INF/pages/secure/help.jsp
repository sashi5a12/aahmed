<h1>2.	Smart Accessories Partner Program Submission Process</h1>
<h2>2.1	OVERVIEW</h2>
<br />
The Smart Accessories Partner Program is a guided process for potential Smart Accessories Partners to aid them in the development of Accessories to ensure that their products are compatible with the latest smart devices on Verizon's network with the added option to label the approved product "Verizon Ready" to be sold outside of the Verizon Retail Channel. Through this partner program you will be able to submit your concept and/or product directly to Verizon's Smart Accessories Team for evaluation and fit to the various Verizon platforms.
<br />
<br />

    <td valign="top">The Partner Portal's main premise is for our partners to have a process to submit new products and/or concepts for next generation Smart Accessories that Verizon can evaluate and provide feedback as well as an opportunity for our partner to proceed through the &quot;Verizon Ready&quot; Compliance testing process. </td>

You can save a draft submission to return to later but once submitted you will not have an opportunity to make changes.
    <br />
    <br />
    The submitted product/concept is sent to one of the Smart Accessories Product Manager for review and hence during this review time no changes can be made. During this phase it is likely the SA Product Manager will reach out to you to discuss you product/concept in greater detail and this will give you the opportunity to give more information if desired.</td>
